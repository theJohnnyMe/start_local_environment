# start_local_environment
Small shell script for starting local environment in iTerm for repo based on docker and yarn.

Feel free to take it and edit it for your needs. I use iTerm2 command line editor, but I think script can be adjusted to any other editor.

On lines 17 and 23 I put comments so you can add your commands/paths that are specific for your setup.

You start it with in iTerm2 by just typing sh and adding path to file, for example: sh /Users/johnny/Desktop/start_local_environment.sh

Enjoy!
